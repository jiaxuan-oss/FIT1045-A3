A Slice of Py Restaurantsüç¥
In this assignment, you will develop a text-based restaurant review management system for a restaurant franchise called "A Slice of Py". More specifically, this program will be used by restaurant managers to monitor reviews about the franchise restaurant, and keep track of the restaurant features of a particular franchise location.

A Slice of Py specialises in local cuisines and could be found all over the world. There can only be at most one restaurant per location (country).

To develop the restaurant review management system, these are the tasks that must be completed:

Develop blueprints to create instances of a restaurant and a menu.

Develop blueprints to create instances of a franchise located in various locations.

Pre-process customer reviews gathered from all the restaurants in various locations.

Analyse the reviews gathered.

Develop functions to visualize the data gathered after carrying out analysis. 

Putting it all together to create a restaurant review management system. 

Please take note that the .txt files provided only feature the signature dishes and drinks for a particular franchise location and is not a comprehensive menu. The reviews.csv provided are reviews "retrieved" from the A Slice of Py webpage.

You'll start off by building out each piece individually and merge your solutions into one Python file that can be executed through Command Prompt or Terminal to play.
