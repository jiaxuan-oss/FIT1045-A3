A national drink is a distinct beverage that is strongly associated with a particular country, and can be part of their national identity and self-image. National drinks fall into two categories: alcoholic and non-alcoholic. An alcoholic national drink is sometimes a liquor drunk straight/neat (e.g., whiskey in Ireland), but is most often a mixed drink (e.g., caipirinhas in Brazil) or beer or wine. A beverage can 
be considered a national drink for a variety of reasons:

It is a common drink, made from a selection of locally available foodstuffs that can be prepared in a distinctive way, such as mango lassi 
that uses dahi, a traditional yogurt or fermented milk product, originating from the Indian subcontinent, usually prepared from cow's milk, and sometimes buffalo milk, goat milk or camel's milk.
It contains a particular 'exotic' ingredient that is produced locally.
It is served as a festive culinary tradition that forms part of a cultural heritage.
It has been promoted as a national dish by the country itself.In some cases, it may be impossible to settle on a national drink for a particular country. In the realm of food at least, it may be impossible to choose a single national dish, even unofficially, for countries such 
as Mexico, China, or India because of their diverse ethnic populations and cultures. Though Tadi has been termed as national drink of India. At the other end of the spectrum, sometimes different countries see the same beverage as their national drink (e.g., pisco sour in Peru and Chile).
The national drinks below are categorized within geo-political regions modified from the United Nations' five "regional groups". This list 
usually does not include moonshines or alcoholic beverages produced illicitly.

== Europe ==

The "beer belt" in Europe includes Germany, the UK, and Ireland, whereas the "wine belt" includes the Mediterranean countries like Spain, Italy, and Greece. Several drinks are common and particular to Slavic countries. Vodka is a clear alcoholic beverage made most often by distilling the liquid from fermented cereal grains and potatoes. Countries where vodka is identified as a national beverage have been referred 
to as the "vodka belt". Kvass is a traditional fermented non-alcoholic beverage commonly made from rye bread and is drank in many Slavic countries, as well as Latvia and Lithuania. Kompot is another drink that is traditionally popular throughout this region and made by boiling 
together different fruit including strawberries, apricots, peaches, apples, and raisins in large volume of water and served hot or cold, depending on tradition and season. Fruit brandies are popular in the Balkans, while Brännvin and Akvavit are popular in Scandinavia.
