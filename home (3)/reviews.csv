 d Country	Review
Brazil	 I've had more joy eating aeroplane food on my 20 hour journey from Australia. You've been warned.
Australia	 Meh. I was excited to eat here but wasn‚Äôt really impressed. There was something about the food that just lacked any genuine feel - it was dry. 
Australia	 was ok/fine,  I think that the portions draws people to this restaurant.  The service was better than the food,
Brazil	**yyy!!!!!yyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy yyyyyyyyy yyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy
New Zealand	A great touch.   
Australia	A great way to finish a great.   
Malaysia	A young waiter was left on his own to cope with too many  tables needing attention. It took 35 min to get a drink another 20 min to get a menu 15 min to order and only because I had to complain to the barman about the lack of attention. 
Malaysia	aa aaaaaaaaa aaa aa aaaa aaaaaaaaa aaaaaaaaa aaa
Peru	aaaaaaaa aaaaa aaaaaaaa 
New Zealand	All I have to say is the food was amazing!!!   
Algeria	Also there are combos which is a decent deal.   
Belarus	Ample portions and good prices.   
Malaysia	Arrived at 1pm Took an hour to get food. Was almost late for work at. Food was dry and not cooked well and my friend found hair in her food. It was a busy night I get it but worst service I have ever experienced. Go ANYWHERE else.  
Wales	At least think to refill my water before I struggle to wave you over for 10 minutes.   
Malaysia	Awful. Service from start to finish was not good. Food was okay. Paid for a meal for 3 & immediately after finishing our food we were continuously asked to leave our table. When we said no (because we paid to be there) we were met with a guilt trip rolled eyes and heavy sighs. I would understand if we had been there for a long time already
Malaysia	bbb bbbbbbbbbbbbbb^^^bbbbb bbbbbbbb!!!! 
New Zealand	beautiful presentation, wide wine list and great dessert   
Nepal	Best breakfast buffet!!!   
Australia	Best servers you'll ever find -- Josh came running after us when he realized my husband had left his sunglasses on the table!
Malaysia	Came for lunch twice - Very Bad Customer Service !!!
Albania	Cheap but just ok
Morocco	Clean but the floor is mostly wet ehich cause me to fall and almost hurt my ankle
Bolivia	Coming here is like experiencing an underwhelming relationship where both parties can't wait for the other person to ask to break up.   
New Zealand	Considering the qualiti, the price is pretty reasonable. !! Prepare to spend at least 100 dollars.
Malaysia	crowded during lunchtime, most people prefer to pack and take away
Azerbaijan	Crust is not good.   
Brazil	did not like at all.   
Malaysia	Do not come during lunch hr Took an hour to get our food only 4 tables in restaurant my food was Luke warm Our sever was running around like he was totally overwhelmed.  
Algeria	do not eat here it's teeeeerrible   
Wales	enjoyed every single morsel of food they have to offer   
New Zealand	Even if the small piece of shortbread was made by hand that morning using gold flakes and the coffee was ground by an angel fanned by butterflies, it was too expensive. Not worth it.
Bolivia	Everything was fresh and delicious!   
Malaysia	Extensive variety but limited taste   
Malaysia	Fantastic dinner excellent value for money the food was excellent. I will certainly be back again!!

Malaysia	Good portions variety and cheap! but do not come during rush hour too crowded - early dinner time is perfectt
Australia	great experience.. best servers..   
Malaysia	Great food and service huge portions and they give a military discount.  
Scotland	Had lunch on a SUnday. Never had haggis before, and I thought the easiest way to try it would be in the form of croquettes.  It was surprisely good üòã. Wife ordered the steak üçñ pie, which was really tender and tasty.
United Kingdom	Hard to judge whether these sides were good because we were grossed out by the melted styrofoam and didn't want to eat it for fear of getting sick.   
Peru	hhhh hhhhhhhh hhh hhhhhhhh hhhhhhhhhh hhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!!!!!!,,
Australia	Highly recommended.

Honduras	Hospitable hosts, delicious dishes!!   
Botswana	I could care less... The interior is just beautiful.   
Australia	I found this place by accident and I could not be happier.   
Dominica	I guess I should have known that this place would suck because it isopposite a sewer but I didn't use my common sense.
Scotland	I had the Steak Pie afterwards which was jam packed with lovely meat and was extremely tasty.
Brazil	I was disgusted because I was pretty sure that was human hair.   
Algeria	I was shocked because no signs indicate cash only.   
United Kingdom	I wish I can give ZERO STAR! !
Australia	Ideal for those who want a romantic night out. There was also plenty of room for bigger groups.
Malaysia	iiii iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii-------------------
Bolivia	In summary this was a largely disappointing dining experience.  
Bolivia	It was not good.   
Australia	It's like a really sexy party in your mouth where you're outrageously flirting with the hottest person at the party.  
Laos	It's too bad the food is so damn generic.   
New Zealand	Loved it...friendly servers great food wonderful and imaginative menu. 
Scotland	Lunch buffet has more selection and is much better than the dinner buffet which was too expensive!
Australia	meats were cooked too tough wish they would make sure that it was medium rare
Australia	My first visit was a delight!   
United Kingdom	Never been here before WILL NEVER EVER STEP FORWARD IN IT AGAIN!  
Afghanistan	not bad 3/5
France	Now I am getting angry and I want my damn fish
Australia	On the up side their cafe serves really good food.  
United Kingdom	On top of that there was dirt on top of the cans of soda and when we went to pay the owner was having a phone conversation the entire time while at the counter and we had to wait until another person who worked there noticed this in order for us to pay for the food. It was overall a very bad experience. 
United Kingdom	one of the worst places i've ever tried - ughhhhh!   
Belarus	Overall I like this place a lot.  
Malaysia	Poor service the lunch waiter made me feel like I was stupid every time he came to the table.  
Malaysia	ppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppp
Scotland	Prices extortionate, choice limited.
Malaysia	Quite good variety, portions and prices! Nice dinner menu and sets
New Zealand	Really enjoyed this place. The food and cocktails were outstanding. The best Bloody Mary I've ever had. I recommend the smoked mackerel pate and mussels.
United Kingdom	say bye bye to your tip lady!   
Botswana	seems like a good quick place to grab a bite of some familiar food but do yourself a favor and look elsewhere.  
Belarus	Service is also cute.   
Dominica	Service sucks.   
Laos	Service was very prompt.   
Wales	Slow service but good food
Belarus	So they performed.   
Bolivia	Stopped by during the late May bank holiday off Rick Steve recommendation and loved it.   
Scotland	Taste is not too bad but pricey considering the meh quality. On a positive note our server was very attentive and provided great service.  
Germany	Taste wasn't great, food was cold by the time it hit th tabel
Cuba	The cashier had no care what so ever on what I had to say it still ended up being wayyy overpriced.   
Australia	The cocktails are all handmade and delicious.   
Afghanistan	The deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and server went above and beyond what we expected.
Honduras	The food amazing.  
Scotland	The food was not very good quality and was overpriced. 
United Kingdom	The food were bland.   
Malaysia	The foods were like rubber and you could tell they had been made up ahead of time being kept under a warmer.   
Scotland	The meats (beef/lamb) are chewy + The food selections are limited
Algeria	The only redeeming quality of the restaurant was that it was very inexpensive.   
Malaysia	The place is horrible. I ordered a ribeye steak and the thing was not edible. I am giving the place a 1 star because I couldn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t give it a 0 (zero) star. Don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t spend your money there. Street vendors foods are much tastier. Their milkshake is not MILKSHAKE. It is milk with Hershey√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s syrup. I am pretty sure they are not even using the Hershey√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s brand but some much cheaper version: HORRIBLE PLACE. Avoid at all costs.   
Australia	The portion was huge!   
Wales	The selection on the menu was great and so were the prices.   
Australia	The service is unmatched.   
Wales	The service was meh.
United Kingdom	the tomatoes were under cooked, sausages were almost raw, they were practically mooing.....
Albania	There is not a deal good enough that would drag me into that establishment again.   
United Kingdom	They have horrible attitudes towards customers and talk down to each one when customers don't enjoy their food.  
Honduras	This cozy restaurant has left the best impressions!   
Malaysia	This place has it!   
Dominica	This place is not worth your time let alone monay

Cuba	This was like the final blow!   
Scotland	Today is the second time I've been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good.   
France	totes recommend to everyone!   
Scotland	Unreasonable price as the choices of food are too few,.The taste is acceptable.
Australia	Update.....went back for a second time and it was still just as amazing   
New Zealand	very heavy on the wallet but if you'r looking for quality then this place is for you
Malaysia	Waitress was a little slow in service.
